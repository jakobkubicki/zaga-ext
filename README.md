# 🌿 Skincare Extension

Skincare Extension is a Chrome extension that scans a webpage for skincare products, lists the active ingredients, and informs you about any potential side effects. It's a tool for anyone who wants to stay informed about the products they encounter online. 

Currently, this extension is in the early stages of development. It is being built with TypeScript, ReactJS, and Node Package Manager. 

## Installation

Use npm to install the necessary packages. 

```
npm install
```

Build the application using 
```
npm run build
```

## Usage

After the packages are installed and the application is built, you can run the extension by following these steps:

1. Go to Chrome -> More Tools -> Extensions
2. Switch on Developer mode
3. Click on 'Load unpacked'
4. Select the build folder of the Skincare Extension

You're now all set to start using the Skincare Extension. Simply navigate to a webpage with skincare products and click the extension icon. The extension will scan the page and display a list of the active ingredients and their potential side effects.
